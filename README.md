## Project Overview

This project transforms the traditional 2D game of **Battleship** into a gritty, cinematic 3D experience using **Three.js**. Players place ships on a shared ocean grid, then engage in turn-based combat that replaces the classic ‚Äúguessing‚Äù mechanic with **skill-based, physics-driven cannon shots**. Dynamic cameras, real-time explosions, and particle effects bring naval warfare to life.

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Loading / Intro**  
   - Press `Enter` to skip or watch the cinematic establishing a high-seas battlefield.

2. **Ship Placement Phase**  
   - Move & rotate each ship on your half of the grid, avoiding overlaps and borders.  
   - Press `Space` to lock in a valid position.  
   - Player 1 places all 5 ships, then Player 2 does the same.

3. **Combat Phase**  
   - Players alternate turns selecting a ship and entering the **Shooting Phase**.

4. **Shooting Phase**  
   - Select a horizontal firing angle via arc overlay.  
   - Then select a vertical angle in a second overlay.  
   - Cannonball is fired along a physics-driven path.

5. **Victory Condition**  
   - The last commander with any remaining ships wins. A final stats screen is displayed.
